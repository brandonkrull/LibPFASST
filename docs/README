This directory contains the source for generating the LibPFASST documentation.  There are two different parts to it:

1. Sphinx-based .rst files located in LibPFASST/docs/

2. FORD (FORtran Documentation) code in FORD

It is expected that the documentation files should only be updated on the gh-pages branch of LibPFASST.

To update the documentation, one should checkout the gs-pages branch and make sure that the files there are the most up to date.
In particular, the Fortran source code in src will need to be refreshed with 'git checkout master -- src'

Then:

1. 'make html' in LibPFASST/docs/
2. 'ford libpfasst.md' in LibPFASST/docs/FORD

Unfortunately the second step currently fails unless two include statements in the files src/pf_mpi.f90 and src/pf_fftw.f90 are commented out.  So do that and rerun 2.

3.  commit the new files to the git repo  (on the gh-pages branch!)

This should update the documentation page at
