This directory contains the parameter files to run the FORD
"FORtran Documenter".

The file libpfasst.md contains the parameters, and running

>ford libpfasst.md will create the html in the directory docs/.

Unfortunately the  line

  include "mpif.h"

pf_mpi.f90 causes FORD to crash, so one must comment that out before running ford.
